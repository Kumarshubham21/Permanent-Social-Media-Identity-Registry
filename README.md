# Permanent Social Media Identity Registry


## Project Description
Permanent Social Media Identity Registry is a blockchain-based identity management system where users can create a permanent public identity linked to their social media presence. Once registered, the username and platform cannot be altered, ensuring authenticity and long-term trust. Only metadata can be updated to reflect evolving profile information.


## Project Vision
To create a decentralized, immutable, and trustworthy identity layer for Web3 that allows users to prove their social media identity permanently across platforms and applications.


## Key Features
- **Permanent Username & Platform Binding**: Once registered, identity cannot be modified.
- **Metadata Upgradability**: Users can update additional profile information such as links, avatars, or bio.
- **Full Decentralization**: Stored and managed on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Verifiable Identity**: Apps can easily verify the authenticity of social media identity.


## Future Scope
- Integration with decentralized storage for richer profile data.
- Cross-chain identity mapping.
- Verified social media account linking using oracles.
- NFT-based identity badges.
- Multi-identity support for different platforms.
